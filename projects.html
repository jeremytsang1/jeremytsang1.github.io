		    This was my first Raspberry Pi project. It was initially a
		    challanged because I had never worked with hardware at this
		    point so it took some trial and error to purchase suitable
		    parts to make sure the robot was able to move properly. For
		    example I had initially intended to use tractor treads instead
		    of wheels since I was planning on driving the robot on uneven
		    terrain eventually but there were many diffulties keeping
		    them attached.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    The actual coding was not terribly difficult to achive simple
		    car-like motion. The most challenging part was by far
		    programming the robot arm since coordinating multiple degrees
		    of freedom was not trivial.

		    This game was a submission for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019">2019
		    itch.io Game Off</a> and was a cooperative project between
		    <a href="https://github.com/positive235">Hae-Ji Park</a>
		    and me.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    The game places the player as the yellow ball whose goal is to
		    collect the green balls without colliding with any of the red
		    balls. However the movement of the yellow ball is restricted to
		    the circling the predefined orbits. The advantage the yellow
		    ball has against the red ones is that it can both jump across
		    different orbits and change direction within a single orbit.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    This game was implemented using Pygame. The obvious challenge
		    for this program was modeling the movement of the balls. To
		    address this I realized the movement is not dissimilar to early
		    atomic models (i.e. the Bohr model) where electrons where
		    purported to orbit around some nucleus. In that model the main
		    coordinate system used is spherical polar, however since this
		    game is only two-dimensional planar polar coordinates will
		    suffice.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		    This game could be extended in multiple ways. For example, one
		    could make it a multiplayer game with other players acting as
		    the red balls. Additionally it would be interesting to maybe
		    program an AI based on how the player's strategy.

		    In Oregon State University's CS 162 course, the final project
		    was to implement the logic for a game of
		    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi">Xianqi (Chinese chess)</a>.
		    This exercise was a good practice in Object Oriented
		    Programming since it is clear that each piece has a different
		    role/behaviour.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		    The main data structure I used to represent the board was a 2D-array due to the	tabular
		    nature of piece positions. Although moves are traditionally
		    represented with "algebraic notation" (e.g. "A1" would be the lower left corner) it
		    was straightforward to make a function to translate these
		    algebraic notations into traditional array indices.
